Hop-To-It

Project Description
"Hop To It" is an application that is based around the enjoyment of craft beers and selected marijuana strains, a popular combination in several cities across America. When the user enters a city name into the search box, the program generates a randomized list of 30 breweries that are in that city. Each brewery list item includes the address, the website, and a button to view the google marker map location. Along with researching breweries with craft beer options, the user can browse marijuana strains and their effects.
